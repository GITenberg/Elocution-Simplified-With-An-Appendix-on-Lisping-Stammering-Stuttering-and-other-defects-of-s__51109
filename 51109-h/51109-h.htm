<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="center">"Why write this book?" say you.<br />

"Because it is needed," say I.</p>


<p>There is no "digest" of elocution that is both
methodical and practical, and that is low in price, now
in the market.</p>

<p>This book is an epitome of the science of elocution,
containing nothing that is not necessary for you to
know, if you wish to make yourself a good reader or
speaker.</p>

<p>You who will thoroughly study and digest this book,
and then put in practice what you here have learned,
will have started on the road, the goal of which is
Oratory.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>Rev. Dr. Hall of New York says, "There is one accomplishment
in particular which I would earnestly recommend
to you: cultivate assiduously the ability to read
well. I stop to particularize this, because it is a thing so
very much neglected, and because it is such an elegant and
charming accomplishment. Where one person is really interested
by music, twenty are pleased by good reading.
Where one person is capable of becoming a skilful musician,
twenty may become good readers. Where there is one occasion
suitable for the exercise of musical talent, there are
twenty for that of good reading.</p>

<p>"What a fascination there is in really good reading!
What a power it gives one! In the hospital, in the chamber
of the invalid, in the nursery, in the domestic and in the
social circle, among chosen friends and companions, how it
enables you to minister to the amusement, the comfort, the
pleasure, of dear ones, as no other accomplishment can! No
instrument of man's devising can reach the heart as does
that most wonderful instrument, the human voice. It is
God's special gift to his chosen creatures. Fold it not away
in a napkin.</p>

<p>"Did you ever notice what life and power the Holy Scriptures
have when well read? Have you ever heard of the
wonderful effects produced by Elizabeth Fry on the criminals
of Newgate by simply reading to them the parable of
the Prodigal Son? Princes and peers of the realm, it is
said, counted it a privilege to stand in the dismal corridors,
among felons and murderers, merely to share with them the
privilege of witnessing the marvellous pathos which genius,
taste, and culture could infuse into that simple story."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Elocution trains the voice to obey the mind, and to rightly
express thought and feeling. It is necessary to those who
read or speak in public; to persons with defective speech; to
those with nasal, shrill, throaty, or husky voices; to persons
with diseased throat, or liability to it, arising from wrong
use of voice.</p>

<p>The practice of the art of elocution is as necessary to the
reader or speaker as practice of the art of singing is to one
who intends to become a public singer. Any one attempting
to sing for the public without previous practice would
be justly hissed from the stage: and a like fate overtakes
most speakers, who, without previous study of elocution,
attempt to speak in public; that is, very few go to hear them.</p>


<p class="center">CLERGYMEN</p>

<p>should learn to read impressively the Bible, Litany, hymns,
and sermons: for as Dr. Holland says, "When a minister
goes before an audience, it is reasonable to ask and expect
that he shall be accomplished in the arts of expression; that
he shall be a good writer and speaker. It makes little
difference that he knows more than his audience, is better
than his audience, has the true matter in him, if the art by
which he conveys his thought is shabby. It ought not to be
shabby, because it is not necessary that it should be. There
are plenty of men who can develop the voice, and so instruct
in the arts of oratory that no man need go into the
pulpit unaccompanied by the power to impress upon the
people all of wisdom that he carries." The same writer
says of</p>


<p class="center">STUDENTS.</p>

<p>"Multitudes of young men are poured out upon the
country, year after year, to get their living by public speech,
who cannot even read well. The art of public speech has
been shamefully neglected in all our higher training-schools.
It has been held subordinate to every thing else, when it is
of prime importance. I believe more attention is now paid
to the matter than formerly. The colleges are training their
students better, and there is no danger that too much attention
will be devoted to it. The only danger is, that the
great majority will learn too late that the art of oratory
demands as much study as any other of the higher arts; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
that, without it, they must flounder along through life practically
shorn of half the power that is in them, and shut out
from a large success."</p>


<p class="center">TEACHERS</p>

<p>should learn elocution so as to teach in a pleasing, effective
manner; and also to teach reading in schools, so that
children may learn to read in an easy, agreeable way, and
give thought to what they read; thus leading a child in all
studies to get ideas from books, and not merely words without
meaning.</p>


<p class="center">PUBLIC SPEAKERS</p>

<p>should, by study of elocution, learn the best manner of
moving, persuading, and instructing their audiences; thus
adding to their own popularity, and consequently widening
their influence.</p>


<p class="center">LAWYERS,</p>

<p>by practice of elocution, will find greater ease in speaking
to witness or jury, and thus be greatly aided in their work.</p>


<p class="center">ACTORS AND PUBLIC READERS</p>

<p>lose both time and money by a neglect of elocution, the
practice of which is essential to success in their vocation.</p>


<p class="center">SINGERS,</p>

<p>by study of elocution, can best obtain that perfect articulation
and elegant expression so necessary to the successful
singer.</p>


<p class="center">ALL PERSONS</p>

<p>who have a taste for reading should study elocution, as
reading aloud in the social or home circle is one of the
most instructive, pleasing, and healthful pastimes in which
we can indulge.</p>


<p class="center">DEFECTIVE SPEECH,</p>

<p>as lisping, stammering, stuttering, &amp;c., can be entirely cured
by a study and diligent practice of elocution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">UNPLEASANT VOICES,</p>

<p>either shrill, nasal, throaty, husky, or with any other disagreeable
quality, can be made agreeable by practice of
elocution.</p>

<p>To meet all these wants, this treatise has been prepared.
Embracing as it does a thorough exposition of the principles
of elocution in an eminently practical form, adapted to
the requirements of the student, the professional man, and
the amateur, by a graduate of the Boston School of Oratory
(acknowledged to be the best Institute of Elocution America
has produced), himself a successful teacher and reader, it
seems to present the whole science in a nutshell, so that he
"who runs may read" in reality, if he but follow the instructions
of this Manual. Here elocution is not only simplified,
but, in this neat and cheap form, placed within the
reach of all.</p>

<h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENT.</h2>


<p>I would here acknowledge my indebtedness to Prof. Lewis
B. Monroe, Dean of Boston University School of Oratory,
for what I have learned of expression in elocution; to Prof.
A. Graham Bell of Boston for valuable instruction in articulation
and inflection; to Prof. Edward B. Oliver of Mendelssohn
Musical Institute of Boston for his most excellent
instruction in tone.</p>

<p>The method of study of this book is the result of the
knowledge gained from these three superior instructors.
The plan of Part Three will be found to be that of Monroe's
Sixth Reader.</p>


<p class="center">METHOD OF STUDY OF ELOCUTION.</p>

<p>Part First, a series of gymnastics to give strength and
elasticity to the muscles used in speaking, to expand the
chest, and to get a correct position of body, so that speaking
may be without effort, and yet powerful.</p>

<p>Part Second, a system of vocal exercises for daily practice,
to train the voice, and get command of tone, quality,
pitch, inflection, force, stress, articulation, and right manner
of breathing.</p>

<p>Part Third, the application of the vocal exercises to the
reading of short extracts, showing the effect when thus applied,
and showing the difference between the seven styles,&mdash;conversational,
narrative, descriptive, didactic, public address,
declamatory, and emotional or dramatic.</p>

<p>There will be found references to select pieces in Baker's
"Reading Club and Handy Speaker," for practice in the
different styles of reading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Hoping this little book may be of benefit to many, it is
sent forth to help those who love the art, but with no
thought of recommending this book for self-instruction, and
substituting it for the instruction to be gained from a good
teacher of the art. If a good teacher is not to be had, use
this book.</p>

<h2>ELOCUTION SIMPLIFIED.</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>PART ONE.<br />
PHYSICAL GYMNASTICS.</h2>


<p>Goethe says, "All art must be preceded by a certain
mechanical expertness."</p>

<p>You find it so in the art of playing the piano: the fingers
must be made nimble, and the wrists elastic, before any thing
else can be well done. In the art of singing you have to
exercise the voice in many ways to get command of it. So,
in the art of elocution, it is necessary to practise the
mechanics of physical and vocal culture, that you may be
prepared to express properly your thought and feeling.</p>

<p>You need first a healthy body, elastic and strong in
muscles, and especially in those muscles used in the production
of voice. For this latter purpose I will describe as
clearly as I can Monroe's system of gymnastics, and for the
former recommend any other gymnastics that will give
health, strength, and especially elasticity.</p>


<h3>ATTITUDE.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Standing Position.</span>&mdash;Hamlet, so Shakespeare tells
us, ends a letter to Ophelia thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Whilst this machine is to him, Hamlet."<br />
</p>

<p>Your body is the machine by means of whose working you
express your mind and feelings. If you were to run a steam-engine,
you would be very careful to place the machine in
such a position, that it would do the most work with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
least wear and tear. You must do the same with this
machine, your body. To get a correct standing position,
place yourself with back against a smooth wall in the room,
with shoulders flat, your back as nearly straight as you can
make it, and every part, from head to heel, touching the wall.
This gives you an upright position, but feels uncomfortable,
because the weight is too much on the heels. Sway the
whole body in its upright position forward, so that the
weight will come mostly on the balls of the feet; and, in
doing so, do not bend any part except at the ankles. You
are now in a proper position for speaking. The head is
erect, shoulders thrown back, chest expanded, back nearly
straight, the weight of the body is about equal on ball and
heel of the feet, and your poise of body as it would be
naturally in the act of taking a step forward. This puts
every part of your body in the best condition for easy speaking.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Speaker's Position.</span>&mdash;This position should be assumed
before an audience when some other position is not
required for dramatic expression. It is the standing position,
with the weight upon one foot, and the other advanced. Let
the advance foot be about a heel's distance from the middle
of the foot behind, and form a right angle with it.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Sitting Position.</span>&mdash;When you read in a sitting
position, the body should be as in speaker's position, and
feet also, the poise of body being forward.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Change of Position.</span>&mdash;You sometimes wish to turn
to address your audience at one side. To change gracefully
from the speaker's position, turn the foot in advance on the
ball, outward, until it becomes parallel with the foot behind;
then take the weight on it, and turn the other foot till you
have correct speaker's position. If, as you stood at first,
facing the audience, your weight was on the right foot, you
will find yourself facing to the right; if the weight was
on left, you will face left. When facing the audience, to
change the weight from one foot to the other, take one short
step either forward or back.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Poise of Body.</span>&mdash;To get steadiness of body, to keep
a correct poise, and to prevent all unseemly swaying, when
standing to read or speak, assume standing position, and,
keeping feet flat on the floor, sway forward until the weight
comes entirely on the ball of the feet. Don't bend the body.
Then sway back to standing position. Then sway backward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
keeping feet flat on the floor and the body straight,
until the weight is entirely on the heels; from that sway forward
to position.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Rise upon the Toes.</span>&mdash;For the same purpose as the
above. Assume standing position, and rise as high as possible
on the toes very slowly; then sink slowly so as to come
back to standing position. Be very careful not to sway
backward in coming down, and you will find yourself in the
exact poise of standing position. Also do the same from
speaker's position, rising on one foot.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Holding the Book.</span>&mdash;Hold your book in the left
hand, on one side of the body, so that your face will not be
hid from the audience. The top of the book should be
about even with the shoulder. Many, in reading, hold the
book in front of them; but that is not so pleasant to an
audience, and leads to a stooping position, a contracted chest,
and ill health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;All the foregoing exercises relate to position of body
necessary for the most powerful, and at the same time the easiest,
action of the vocal organs; also to the attitudes most pleasing
to an audience when they look upon a reader or speaker. Practise
them until they become habits, and so unconsciously you will
assume correct position when you stand.</p>


<h3>CHEST EXPANSION.</h3>

<p>For purposes of speech, you need to use more breath than
for ordinary breathing or conversation. You therefore need
to make as much room as possible for good fresh air by
exercise to expand the chest. Elocution is beneficial to
health for this reason.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Active and Passive Chest.</span>&mdash;Your chest in its
ordinary position is what, in elocution, is called passive chest.
The active chest is that assumed in the standing position,
where the chest is raised up slightly and expanded, with the
shoulders drawn back. Practise as an exercise the active
and passive chest, alternating from one to the other without
breathing, or moving the shoulders. The active chest must
be kept in all the physical and vocal gymnastics, and at all
time during speech. With practice it will soon become
established as a habit; and your every-day attitude will be
more erect as a consequence.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Arms at Side.</span>&mdash;Place your arms at the side, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
elbows bent, so that from elbow to hand the arms are horizontal,
and parallel with each other. Draw the elbows back,
clinch the fist with palms up, and make chest active, keeping
the back straight. Take a full breath, and hold it (see
"Breathing"); then carry the arms at full length in front
of you, your hands open and as high up as the shoulders;
then bring them back to the position you started from, with
hands clinched, palms up, and pull back with all your
strength, raising the chest slightly more; then give out the
breath. After some practice you may do it twice upon one
breath, being sure to keep the arms as close to the body as
you can; for, if you spread your arms, you will strain the
muscles.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Fore-arm Vertical.</span>&mdash;Assume standing position, and
bend the arms, placing them vertically, and parallel with
each other, at the side, with clinched hands as high as the
shoulder; turn the fist out from the shoulder, raise the
chest as much as you can, and, taking a full breath, hold it;
bring the arms forward so as to touch the elbows together,
if you can; then draw them back to first position, and pull
downward and backward as hard as you can; then give out
the breath. After some practice, do this twice on one breath,
being sure to keep the arms and hands close to the body.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Full-arm Percussion.</span>&mdash;In ordinary breathing, it is
seldom you fill your lungs to their fullest capacity; and
some of the air-cells are not filled, especially those at the
extreme edges of the lungs. This and the following exercise
are for the purpose of sending air into those portions
of the lungs not ordinarily filled. Assume standing position;
take a full breath, and hold it; then strike with the
right hand upon the top of the left chest a very quick and
very elastic blow, striking with fingers, and swinging the
arm freely from its position at the side; then strike with
left hand on right chest in same manner; repeat with each
hand, and then give out the breath. Never strike with the
flat palm or clinched fist, as that is very injurious and unhealthy.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Hand Percussion.</span>&mdash;Assume standing position, and
place your hands on your chest, with elbows as high as the
shoulders; make chest active; take a full breath, and retain
it while you strike alternately eight light elastic blows with
each hand; then give out the breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>


<h3>BODY MOVEMENTS.</h3>

<p>The muscles of the waist are the front or abdominal, the
side or costal, the back or dorsal muscles. These muscles
are very important in speech; and upon the strength and
elasticity of these, and the inner muscles acting in connection
with them, depend the force and strength of your
voice. Three very simple movements are here given, which
will give some measure of strength and elasticity to these
muscles.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Body bend Forward and Back.</span>&mdash;From standing
position bend forward, keeping the back straight, and bending
only at the hip-joints; touch the floor with your hands,
if you can; then assume upright position, and bend back as
far as you can.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Bend Right and Left.</span>&mdash;From standing position,
bend to right side as far as possible, bending only at the
waist, and stretching the costal muscles; then assume upright
position, and bend to left in same manner.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Turn Right and Left.</span>&mdash;From standing position
turn the body on the waist, keeping the hips still, and
twisting the waist-muscles, first to the right, then to the left.</p>


<h3>NECK MOVEMENTS.</h3>

<p>The neck movements are necessary, because many of the
disagreeable qualities of the voice are due to inelasticity of
the muscles of the neck. The movements are in the same
directions as for the body.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Bend forward and back.</span></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Bend right and left.</span></p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Turn right and left.</span></p>

<p>It is not necessary to describe them at length: but, in
bending right and left, be careful to keep the head from
bending slightly backward or forward at the same time; and,
in the turning of head, keep it erect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This completes the physical gymnastics. Practise
them until the purpose for which they are intended has been
accomplished, and afterwards occasionally, to keep what you
have gained. Take each exercise two or three times in succession.
When thoroughly learned, this will not take more than
five minutes. Practise them five minutes at morning and night.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>




<h2>PART TWO.<br />

VOCAL GYMNASTICS.</h2>


<p>You have no need to take any special exercise in walking
for the ordinary purposes of life; but, if you wished to
be a "walkist," you would need special practice to train and
develop the muscles for that purpose. You may be a good
singer, able to sing for your own amusement or that of
your friends, without specially training the singing-voice;
but, if you wished to sing in public, you would, if you were
wise, train your singing-voice very carefully. As in these
cases, so with the voice in speaking. For all ordinary purposes
of speech, you need no special training of the speaking-voice;
but when, as teacher, clergyman, lawyer, lecturer,
actor, public reader, or in any other capacity, you are called
upon to do more with the voice than others, you ought to
train and develop your vocal powers. For this purpose, the
following series of exercises are given for practice.</p>


<h3>BREATHING.</h3>

<p>As it is necessary that you should take in and give out
more breath in speaking than at other times, you ought to
be able to do this in a natural manner. If you will practise
these breathing-exercises until they are easy for you, the
breath in your reading or speaking will take care of itself.
Practise breathing in the open air, and take in and give out
the breath through the nose without making the slightest
sound in so doing.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Abdominal Breathing.</span>&mdash;Take standing position
and active chest; place the fingers on the abdominal
muscles, and the thumbs on the costal muscles; take a full
breath, making the abdominal muscles start first, and move
outward; then let the muscles sink in as the breath comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
out. Make as much movement of these muscles as you
can, both in and out; and be sure you keep the shoulders
from moving. Pay particular attention to the movement
of the abdominal muscles, letting all the rest (except the
shoulders) move as may be easy to you. Practise this way
of breathing until you can do it easily; and, if it makes you
dizzy, do not be alarmed, but wait till the dizziness is entirely
gone before you try again.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Costal Breathing.</span>&mdash;Assume standing position with
active chest; place the fingers on the costal muscles, and
thumbs at the back; inhale a full breath, expanding as
much as possible the costal muscles and ribs. In giving out
the breath, make them sink in as much as possible. Keep
shoulders still in breathing in and out, and let all other
muscles be free to move as they may.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Dorsal Breathing.</span>&mdash;Assume standing position with
active chest; place the fingers at the back on dorsal muscles,
and thumbs on the side; take a full breath, trying to
expand the muscles under your fingers as much as you can.
Rightly done, the abdominal and costal muscles, and the
ribs, will also expand; the chest, if not already active, will
rise; the shoulders will remain quiet. In giving out the
breath, let the chest be the last to sink. This is the way of
breathing in every healthy man, woman, and child. Any
manner of dressing the body that hinders free and easy
action of the abdominal, costal, and dorsal muscles, and
the ribs, leads to ill health, because it interferes with the
vital process of breathing; and ill health is fatal to success
in any art.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Puffing the Breath.</span>&mdash;Assume standing position,
with active chest; take a full breath, and, rounding the lips
as if you were about to say the word "who," blow the breath
out as you would in blowing out a light; inhale again, and
repeat the puffing.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Puff and Pause.</span>&mdash;Puff the breath as before, three
times, pausing about five or more seconds, holding the
breath between the puffs. In holding the breath, let there
be no pressure upon the lungs or throat, but control it by
keeping the waist-muscles still. (See "Holding Breath.")</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Puff and Breathe.</span>&mdash;Puff three times in the same
way as before, breathing between the puffs, thus: place the
fingers of one hand on the upper part of the chest, the fingers
of the other hand on the abdominal muscles; keep the chest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
still, and make the abdominal muscles sink every time you
puff out the breath, and expand, every time you take in
breath, between the puffs. In this exercise breathe through
both nose and mouth. By practice of these three ways of
expelling breath you get command of it.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Holding the Breath.</span>&mdash;When you hold your breath
for a longer or shorter time, or try to control it for any
purpose of speech, you should do so by means of the muscles
spoken of in "Dorsal Breathing," as being the ones used in
right manner of breathing. You must try to control the
breath by keeping the waist-muscles still; and there should
be no feeling of pressure or uneasiness on the lungs, or in the
throat or mouth. "If at first you don't succeed, try, try
again: time will bring you your reward: try, try again."
Get control of the waist-muscles so as to keep them still;
and, while you hold them still, there is no possibility of the
breath getting out.</p>


<h3>TONE.</h3>

<p>A good tone in speech is as much to be desired as it is in
song. Some have it as a gift of nature; and all can acquire
it, in a degree, by judicious practice. If you have an excellent
voice, you can make it still more excellent by practice;
and, if you have a poor voice, you can, by practice, make it
full, pleasant, and effective, and excel that one who has a
good voice, but makes no effort to improve it. The tone-exercises
here given are designed to give command of tone,
and develop purity and power. They should be practised
five minutes at a time, at four different times of the day,
and double that time if possible, in order to get the greatest
amount of good from them. Use any tones of your voice,
high or low, without being at all particular about an exact
musical pitch; though, if you can practise with an organ or
piano, you will find it much more beneficial.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Glottis Stroke.</span>&mdash;Assume standing position with
active chest; take full breath, and whisper forcibly the word
"who" three times. Repeat the same. Now whisper
"who" twice, and speak it aloud the third time; then whisper
"who" once, and speak it aloud the second and third
time; then speak "who" aloud three times. Now speak
"who" twice, and the third time say "<i>oo</i>" as those letters
sound in the word <i>woo</i>; then say "who" once, and "<i>oo</i>" the
second and third time; then "<i>oo</i>" three times. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
should make both the whisper and vocal sound very short
and sudden, without any feeling of contraction or effort in
the throat or mouth. It should seem to you as if the sound
came from the lips; and, while you are energetic in the exercise,
it must be done with perfect ease. You have thus proceeded,
from an easy, forcible whisper, to an easy, forcible
sound, and have thus obtained what is called the "Glottis
Stroke." After diligent practice on the above exercise, use
any of the short vowels (see "Articulation"); speaking each
vowel three times very shortly, as you did the vowel-sound
<i>oo</i>.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Soft Tones.</span>&mdash;Assume standing position with active
chest, and take breath; prolong very softly <i>oo</i> as long as
your breath will let you, being careful not to force the sound
to continue after you feel the slightest need of breath, and
also not to change the position of the mouth from beginning
to end of the sound. Repeat three times. In this
exercise you will probably hear the voice waver, and find it
difficult to keep it very soft, and yet distinct. Practice
will overcome this, and the exercise will be found very
beneficial. The ability to do it shows cultivation of voice.
After some time, use also the long vowels. (See "Articulation.")</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Swelling Tones.</span>&mdash;Assume standing position with
active chest, and take full breath; then begin the vowel <i>oo</i>
very softly, and gradually swell it to a full tone, and then as
gradually diminish it to the gentlest sound. Be careful, as
in soft tone, as to breath, and position of mouth. After
some practice, you should be able to continue on one breath,
either the soft tone or swelling tone, twenty seconds; which
is long enough for practical purposes. Use same vowels
as in soft tone.</p>


<h3>PITCH.</h3>

<p>It is necessary to all expressive reading that there should
be as much variation in pitch of voice&mdash;that is, as to high
and low tones&mdash;as possible, and not overdo. The pleasantest
quality of voice, without variation in pitch, is tiresome to the
listener. To get command of pitch, you must practise till
the high and low tones are as easy to make as the common
conversational tones. If you can sing the musical scale of
one octave in key of C, or B flat, you will find these exercises
more beneficial than if you cannot sing. If you cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
sing, take a relatively high or low pitch, as your ear may
guide you, and practise the chanting and reading of sentences
as well as you can.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Learn the Musical Scale.</span>&mdash;Sing the scale in
music, using first the glottis stroke; that is, speak each very
short as you go up and down the scale. Then practise soft
tone and swelling tone on each tone within compass of your
voice.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Chant Sentences.</span>&mdash;Use one tone of voice, and take
any sentence, prolonging the words without reference to the
sense, without change of tone from beginning to end. When
you use a high tone, make it light and clear; when you use
a low tone, make it full, free, and forcible. Chant on each
tone separately within the compass of the voice.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Read Sentences.</span>&mdash;Use the same sentences as for
chanting, and, beginning on each tone of the voice, speak it
as you would in earnest conversation, in a way to give the
meaning of it. You will see that if you begin with high
pitch, although your voice varies in speaking, it will be a
relatively high pitch through the whole sentence; and, if you
begin low, it will be relatively low. With high pitch, make
your voice light and clear; and with low pitch, full, free, and
forcible.</p>


<h3>INFLECTION.</h3>

<p>In inflection the voice slides up or down in pitch on a
word, and by so doing impresses your meaning on the listener.
Inflections are infinite in number; but a few of them
practised will be of benefit in getting command over them.
When the voice slides up, it is called rising inflection; if
down, a falling. If it slides both ways on the same word, it
is called circumflex; and if it varies but little, and is very
like a chant in song, it is called monotone. A major inflection
gives an effect of strength; a minor, of feebleness.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Major Falling Inflection.</span>&mdash;A falling inflection is
indicated by (`) over the accented syllable of an emphatic
word. If you do not already know the difference between a
rising and falling inflection, suppose I say to you, "The book
is on the table," and you, not understanding what place I
said, should ask, "Where?" and I answer, "On the table."
Your question would be made with rising, and my answer
with falling inflection. Use any vowel-sounds, and practise
the falling inflection as you would hear it on the word "table,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
avoiding all motion of head, arms, or body, and making it
with much energy of voice, as if expressing strong determination.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Major Rising Inflection.</span>&mdash;This is indicated by a (&acute;)
over the emphatic word. Practise with any vowel-sounds
the inflection as you would hear it on "where," as above,
observing same directions as in major falling inflections.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Major Rising and Falling Inflections.</span>&mdash;Practise
rising followed by falling, as &oacute;h, &ograve;h, &aacute;h, &agrave;h, a&#7811;e, a&#7809;e, &amp;c.,
using long and short vowels. Then falling followed by
rising, as &ograve;h, &oacute;h, &agrave;h, &aacute;h, a&#7811;e, a&#7809;e, &amp;c., using long and short
vowels. Use these as if asking a simple unimportant question,
and giving a like answer; then a question and answer
of earnestness; then of surprise; then of great astonishment.
In so doing, your voice will range higher and lower
in inflection than you otherwise would make it. Do not let
any of the inflections sound plaintive or feeble, but make
them strong and decisive.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Minor Rising and Falling Inflections.</span>&mdash;Use the
same exercises as under major rising and falling, just mentioned;
with this difference, that you make them so as to
sound week, feeble, plaintive, or sad. They should be practised
that you may become familiar with their sound, and
have them at command, so as to use them when needed for
expression, and avoid them when not.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Circumflex Inflection.</span>&mdash;This inflection is indicated
by a mark (v &#7463;)  or (&#9697; &#9696;) because it is a combination of
rising and falling inflection. The first is rising circumflex,
because it ends with the rising; the second is falling circumflex,
because it ends with falling inflection. It is used
in expression of doubt, irony, sarcasm; as in "The Merchant
of Venice," act 1, scene 3, Shylock says to Antonio,
"Hath a d&#466;g m&#466;ney? Is it possible a cur can lend three
thousand d&#468;cats?" You will see, if read to express Shylock's
irony and sarcasm, that the words would be inflected,
as marked, with rising circumflex. Practise these circumflex
inflections with vowels as directed under major rising
and falling inflections. The falling circumflex being the
reverse of the rising, when once you are familiar with the
rising, can be easily made.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Monotone.</span>&mdash;This comes as near to being one tone
of voice as it can be, and at the same time keep its expressiveness
as reading. It is not really, as its name might indicate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
one tone, as that would be like chanting in singing;
but it is variation of inflection within very small limit of
range in pitch. It is best practised as song, however. Prolong,
on a low pitch, any of the long vowels, about five
seconds. The mark for monotone is (-) placed over a word.</p>


<h3>QUALITY.</h3>

<p>The quality of the voice is that which affects us agreeably
or disagreeably; and we say it is gruff, or husky, or harsh,
or pleasant, &amp;c. Four general and distinct qualities need to
be practised until they are at command of the mind.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Whisper.</span>&mdash;Whisper the long and short vowels very
easily and quietly at first, without the slightest feeling of
effort in throat or mouth, and perfectly free from hoarseness
or murmuring. As soon as you can make a clear whisper
heard across the room, whisper so as to be heard farther off,
and so proceed gradually, day by day, until you can whisper,
clearly and without effort, loud enough to be heard in a
large hall. Do not practise whispering more than three
minutes at a time.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Aspirate Quality.</span>&mdash;This is what, in general, is
called undertone. It is a mixture of whisper and voice, and
is what you would be likely to use when in company you
speak to any one with a desire not to be overheard by others.
Practise with vowels as in whisper.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Pure Quality.</span>&mdash;Speak the long vowels in your conversational
tone as pleasantly as you can, tossing the tone
lightly, as if speaking to some one across a large hall.
Speak each vowel three times on one breath. Practise them
first speaking shortly, then with prolonging of each tone
not over five seconds.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Orotund Quality.</span>&mdash;This quality is seldom to be
heard in uncultivated voices, but is much to be desired in a
speaker. It can only be acquired slowly and with much
practice. It will be easily recognized when heard, as it
possesses a fulness and richness of tone very pleasing. It
is not high, but seems low in pitch; and, although it does not
sound loud, it seems to be effective, and reach a long distance.
To acquire it, practise, as recommended in "Pitch,"
the chanting and reading of sentences on the conversational
and lower tones of the voice; also swelling tone under
"Tone," on low pitch, using long vowels, especially <i>oo</i>, oh,
awe, ah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>


<h3>FORCE.</h3>

<p>Force is the degree of loudness or softness we may give to
the voice. You should be able to speak gently without
feebleness or weakness of voice, and so as to be distinctly
heard in a large hall, and also to make the fullest and loudest
voice without showing any effort to do so.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Gentle Force.</span>&mdash;Chant and read sentences, as under
"Pitch," with the gentlest force you can, and yet make it
so as to seem to be clear and distinct. Do this on every
pitch you can, high or low.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Moderate Force.</span>&mdash;Read and chant as above on the
middle and higher tones, with about the force of earnest
conversation.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Loud Force.</span>&mdash;Read and chant as above, using only
the middle and lower tones of the voice, making the loudest
tones you can, without straining the throat. Force of voice
depends on the management of the muscles below the lungs;
and you should have perfect freedom from all effort on the
part of lungs, throat, or mouth, on any pitch, high, middle,
or low. If any effort is perceptible to you, it will be a feeling
of strength and power at the waist; and experience and
practice must teach you how much or how little effort to
make at that point. The loudest force, and at the same
time the purest quality, is secured when it seems to make itself
without the slightest feeling of effort on your part.</p>


<h3>STRESS.</h3>

<p>Stress is the manner of applying force to a word or accented
syllable. Prof. L. B. Monroe, in his book on vocal
culture, enumerates six kinds. The marks he uses to represent
them exhibit clearly to the eye what the voice is required
to do. With radical, terminal, and compound stress,
after facility is gained by use of stroke from the shoulder,
omit it, and do them forcibly without movement of any
part of the body.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Radical Stress.</span>&mdash;So called, because the stress is
on the beginning of the word, and marked thus (&gt;). Assume
standing position with active chest, and take breath;
touch the fingers to the shoulder, and strike forward and
downward, stopping the hands half way, and clinching the
fist very tightly; at the moment of stopping, speak the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
vowel "ah" very shortly. You will notice that the voice
issues full, and seems to suddenly vanish in a manner well
indicated by the mark above. Use any vowels, long or short,
with middle pitch of voice. Practise afterward without
any movement of the arms.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Median Stress.</span>&mdash;So called, because the force is on
the middle of the word, marked thus (&lt;&gt;). It is the same
as swelling tone, but is much shorter. Practise with long
vowels on middle tones of voice, making three short swells
on the same vowel in one breath.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Terminal Stress.</span>&mdash;So called, because the force is on
the end of the word, and marked thus (&lt;). Use the same
movement as in radical stress; begin the sound softly when
the hand leaves the shoulder, stopping it suddenly as the
hands clinch. The voice seems to be jerked out. Practise
also without arm-movements, using the same vowels as in
radical stress.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Thorough Stress.</span>&mdash;So called, because the force is
loud from beginning to end, and marked thus (=). Prolong
about ten seconds long vowels, with a loud full voice
on middle pitch.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Compound Stress.</span>&mdash;So called, because it is a union
of radical and terminal stress, and marked (&gt;&lt;). The force
is on both beginning and end of the word, and may be made
by striking twice in succession, continuing the voice from
radical to terminal without pause of voice between the
strokes.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Tremolo Stress.</span>&mdash;This is a trembling of voice, and
marked thus (&#12336;). Prolong long vowels,
making the voice tremble while you do so.</p>


<h3>MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>Movement is the degree of rapidity or slowness with
which you speak the articulate sounds. The danger in fast
movement is, that you will not articulate plainly; and in
slow, that you will drawl.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Quick Movement.</span>&mdash;Use exercise of chanting and
reading sentences, as under "Pitch," using the middle tones
of voice; and repeat the words with the utmost possible
rapidity, with perfect articulation. In chanting, do not mind
the sense; but, in reading, be particular to give the meaning
of the sentence.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Moderate Movement.</span>&mdash;Use exercise as above
about as fast as ordinary talking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Slow Movement.</span>&mdash;Use exercise as above, with very
slow movement of voice. In chanting, prolong each word
about alike; in reading, give good expression, and you will
see that the more important words usually take the longest
time.</p>


<h3>ARTICULATION.</h3>

<p>Articulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds,
which, when combined, make language. You have been
using the sounds that make up speech, in combination, every
day; but it is a good practice to make each element separately.
After you are able to make each sound distinctly,
you will find you can make yourself understood in a large
hall without using a loud voice. Your jaw, lips, and tongue
should move actively and easily. For this purpose use long
vowels,&mdash;No. 1, No. 8, No. 14,&mdash;speaking them in quick
succession, one after the other, making them distinct, and
making the jaw and lips move as much as you can with
ease. Continue to the extent of your breath. Then use the
same with <i>p</i>, <i>b</i>, or <i>m</i> before them; then
with <i>t</i>, <i>d</i>, or <i>n</i>; then <i>k</i>, <i>g</i>,
or <i>y</i>. Continue this practice about five minutes at a
time, until the jaw, lips, and tongue will move with perfect
ease.</p>


<h3>ELEMENTARY SOUNDS.</h3>

<p>In the exercises here given, use the sound, not the name
of the letters which represents the sound, and practise separately
the sounds represented by the Italic letters below.
The only correct way to learn them is from the lips of a
competent teacher; but you will do well, and improve, if you
try the best you can in your way.</p>

<p>Of the vowels, the numbers indicate positions of mouth;
and, where numbers are alike, the positions are alike. Each
vowel-sound is made by unobstructed sounds issuing through
a certain position of mouth. The position is unchanged
with single vowels, and those have but one number. The
position changes in double vowels and diphthongs; and those
have two numbers,&mdash;one large, one small. As each number
represents a position of mouth, you can easily see by comparing
what sounds are made from combining others. The
number in the largest size type of the two represents the
position that is kept when the sound is prolonged: as in 8<sup>1</sup>
prolong the 8 or <i>a</i>h, and make <sup>1</sup> or <i>ee</i> very short; and in <sup>1</sup>14
make <sup>1</sup> very short, and prolong 14. The positions represented
by the small figures are called "Glides," because the position
is hardly assumed before the sound is finished. Diphthongs
are sounds made by combining vowel-sounds, as 8<sup>1</sup> <i>a</i>h-<i>ee</i>.
Of the consonants, or, as well named by Prof. Bell, articulations,&mdash;because
two parts of the mouth have to come together
and separate in order to finish the element, thus obstructing
the breath or voice,&mdash;those in line across the page with
each other are alike in position of mouth; those in first
column are made with breath only, passing out through the
mouth; those in second column, with sound passing out
through the mouth; those in third column are sound passing
out through the nose. For instance, <i>p</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>m</i>, are in line
with each other; and, if you will make the three sounds represented
by those letters, you will see that the same position
of mouth is assumed for each, and that <i>p</i> is breath forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
out of mouth, <i>b</i> is sound out of mouth, <i>m</i> is sound passing
out of nose.</p>

<p>Practise these sounds of vowels and articulations until
you can make them forcibly and easily, with elastic movement
of jaw, tongue, and lips; and remember that force
depends on the strength and good control of muscles below
the lungs. Then unite them by placing articulations before
vowels, giving most force to the vowel, but make both clear
and distinct. Then use articulations both before and after
the vowel, still giving the vowel the most force, but making
the articulation that begins and ends equally distinct
and clear. To arrange these for your practice in this small
book would take too much space. You have above each
element of the English language clearly shown, and can
easily combine them as directed.</p>

<h2>PART THREE.<br />

ELOCUTION.</h2>


<p>If you have faithfully practised Parts One and Two, you
have gained some control of voice, and can now begin elocution,
or expression of thought and feeling. In each of the short
extracts you will find some thought and feeling to express;
and if you will take pains to understand thoroughly what
you have to speak, and then speak earnestly as the thought
and feeling prompts you, you will certainly improve. Speak
to some person; and, if no one is present, imagine that there
is, and talk to them: for you need never speak aloud, unless
it is for some one besides yourself to hear. Your first endeavor
as a speaker should be to make a pleasant quality of
voice, so that you may make good listeners of your audience.
The following exercises suggest pleasure, and let your voice
suggest the sentiment.</p>

<p>7. A cheerful man is pre-eminently a useful man. He
knows that there is much misery, but that misery is not the
rule of life. He sees that in every state people may be
cheerful; the lambs skip, birds sing and fly joyously, puppies
play, kittens are full of joyance, the whole air is full of
careering and rejoicing insects; that everywhere the good
outbalances the bad, and that every evil that there is has
its compensating balm.</p>

<h3>ARTICULATION.</h3>

<p>With pleasant quality you will make listeners; but you
will soon weary them, unless you make them understand by
clear articulation. You have made the organs of articulation
elastic by practice of elementary sounds separately and
in combination. In combinations you have made syllables,
and these syllables make words, words make phrases, phrases
make sentences, sentences make up a discourse, address, oration,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Syllables.</span>&mdash;Every syllable contains a vowel, or its
equivalent; as in the following word, which is separated by
hyphens into syllables,&mdash;in-com-pre-hen-si-ble: you will
hear a vowel-sound in each, the last syllable having the
sound of <i>l</i> as an equivalent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Words.</span>&mdash;A word may have one or more syllables; and,
when it has two or more, one of them will receive slightly
more force than the others, as in the word "common."
Pronounce it, and you will give more force to "<i>com</i>" than
"<i>mon</i>." This force applied is called accent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accent.</span>&mdash;In pronouncing words, you will notice that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the longest words, even while you make each syllable distinct,
there is no perceptible pause until the word is finished.
In words of two or three syllables you will find accent as
above; but words of four or more syllables have one accented,
and perhaps two syllables besides, that receive less
force than the accented, but more than the others. Pronounce
incomprehensibility. Properly done, you will hear
that you give "<i>bil</i>" the strongest accent, and "<i>com</i>" and
"<i>hen</i>" slight accent, but more than the remaining syllables,
"<i>in</i>," "<i>pre</i>," "<i>si</i>," "<i>i</i>," "<i>ty</i>." The accent on "<i>bil</i>" is
primary accent; and on the "<i>com</i>" and "<i>hen</i>" secondary
accent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phrases.</span>&mdash;Two or more words make a phrase; and a
phrase gives you an idea, perhaps, needing a number of
phrases to make complete sense. You should speak phrases
just as you would a long word, without perceptible pause,
and with more force on prominent words than others. Here
is a sentence composed of two phrases: "Fear the Lord,
and depart from evil." A poor reading of this would be,
"Fear (pause) the Lord, (pause) and depart (pause) from
evil." A good reading would be, "Fear the Lord, (pause)
and depart from evil."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emphasis.</span>&mdash;As in words you have primary and secondary
accent, so in phrases you have what is known as emphasis.
In the sentence just given, the words that had most
force were "<i>Lord</i>" and "<i>evil</i>;" and less force, "<i>fear</i>" and
"<i>depart</i>;" and little or no force, "<i>the</i>," "<i>and</i>," and "<i>from</i>."
You may call this primary and secondary emphasis, the
primary having, as in accent, most force.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sentences.</span>&mdash;These phrases, or groups of words somewhat
connected in idea, make sentences; and a sentence
gives complete sense. As syllables make words, and in
words you have an accented syllable; as words make
phrases, and in phrases you have an emphatic word: so, in
sentences composed of phrases, you have an important
phrase; and this important phrase must be impressed upon
the mind of the listener more strongly than any other. This
is done by slightly added force and a trifle higher pitch;
and, as you will readily see, the emphatic word of the important
phrase is the emphatic word of the whole sentence.
Thus you have the structure of sentences; and, if you proportion
your force well, you will not fail to give the meaning
correctly. In the following sentence, the phrases are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
separated by commas; the emphatic words are in <span class="smcap lowercase">SMALL
CAPITALS</span>; the secondarily emphatic words are in <i>Italics</i>.
First understand what the sentence means, then speak it
as you would in earnest conversation, and you will be likely
to give it correctly.</p>

<p>"We <span class="smcap lowercase">ALL</span> of us, in a great <i>measure</i>, <i>create</i> our own <span class="smcap lowercase">HAPPINESS</span>,
which is not <i>half</i> so much <i>dependent</i> upon <span class="smcap lowercase">SCENES</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">CIRCUMSTANCES</span> as most <i>people</i> are apt to <span class="smcap lowercase">IMAGINE</span>."</p>

<p>In this sentence the important phrase is, "create our own
happiness;" and the other phrases must be and are, by a
good reader, subordinated to this one. This subordination
of phrases to the principal one is made by lowering the pitch
slightly, and lessening the force slightly on the subordinate
phrases. It is naturally done if you'll talk the sentence
understandingly.</p>

<p>In the following sentences,&mdash;</p>

<p>1st, Sound each element of a word separately.</p>

<p>2d, Pronounce each word separately, with proper accent,
being careful to give each element correctly.</p>

<p>3d, Read in phrases, remembering that each phrase should
be pronounced as a long word, without pause, and with
emphasis.</p>

<p>4th, Read in sentences, subordinating all other phrases to
the principal phrase.</p>

<p>3. Grandfather is old. His back, also, is bent. In the
street he sees crowds of men looking dreadfully young, and
walking dreadfully swift. He wonders where all the old
folks are. Once, when a boy, he could not find people
young enough for him, and sidled up to any young stranger
he met on Sundays, wondering why God made the world so
old. Now he goes to Commencement to see his grandsons
take their degree, and is astonished at the youth of the
audience. "This is new," he says: "it did not use to be so
fifty years before."</p>

<p>6. Be not lulled, my countrymen, with vain imaginations
or idle fancies. To hope for the protection of Heaven, without
doing our duty, and exerting ourselves as becomes men,
is to mock the Deity. Wherefore had man his reason, if it
were not to direct him? wherefore his strength, if it be not
his protection? To banish folly and luxury, correct vice
and immorality, and stand immovable in the freedom in
which we are free indeed, is eminently the duty of each
individual at this day. When this is done, we may rationally
hope for an answer to our prayers&mdash;for the whole
counsel of God, and the invincible armor of the Almighty.</p>

<h3>FULNESS AND POWER.</h3>

<p>Fulness of voice is necessary, that, when you are speaking
in a large hall, your voice may be powerful. Most persons
could make themselves heard, and, with good articulation,
understood; but yet they would lack power, because the
voice wants fulness. The extracts given below will suggest
to you the necessity of a full voice to express them well.
Observe these directions in trying to get a full, energetic
tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st, Correct speaker's position, take active chest, and
keep it.</p>

<p>2d, Take full breath, breathe often, and control it. (See
"Holding Breath.")</p>

<p>3d, Articulate perfectly.</p>

<h3>INFLECTION.</h3>

<p>Inflection is a slide of voice, either up or down in pitch,
or both, on the accented syllable of a word. You have
learned in previous pages what kinds there are. Major
inflections express strength: minor express weakness.</p>

<p>Rising inflections refer to something to come that shall
complete the sense. If you speak a phrase that needs another
to complete its meaning, you will use a rising inflection to
connect them. If you defer to another's will, opinion, or
knowledge, in what you say, you will use a rising inflection.
If you speak of two or more things, thinking of them as a
whole, and not separately, you use a rising inflection.</p>

<p>Falling inflections are used when a phrase or sentence is
complete in itself. If you state your own will, opinion, or
knowledge, you will use falling inflection. If you speak of
two or more things separately, wishing to make each one by
itself distinct in the hearer's mind, you will use falling
inflections.</p>

<p>Circumflex inflections, being composed of rising and falling
inflections combined, are doubtful in meaning; for if
rising means one thing, and falling means another, a combination
must mean doubt. It expresses irony, sarcasm, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Monotone is a varying of inflection within very narrow
limits, and comes as near to chanting as the voice can, and
still retain the expressiveness of inflection in speech. It
expresses any slow-moving emotions, as grandeur, awe,
solemnity, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Practise the short extracts under each head until you are
sure you give the right inflection in the right place.</p>

<p>1. Would the influence of the Bible, even if it were not
the record of a divine revelation, be to render princes more
tyrannical, or subjects more ungovernable; the rich more
insolent, or the poor more disorderly? Would it make worse
parents or children, husbands or wives, masters or servants,
friends or neighbors?</p>

<p>2. But why pause here? Is so much ambition praiseworthy,
and more criminal? Is it fixed in nature that the
limits of this empire should be Egypt on the one hand, the
Hellespont and Euxine on the other? Were not Suez and
Armenia more natural limits? Or hath empire no natural
limit, but is broad as the genius that can devise, and the
power that can win?</p>

<h3>PITCH.</h3>

<p>The general pitch of voice varies with the emotion. Some
feelings we are prompted to express in the high tones, as
joy; some in the lower tones, as awe: but, without practice,
very few have command of the higher and lower tones; and,
when they attempt to read, they cannot give the requisite
variety to make it expressive. It is important that these
exercises should be studied until you can as easily read in
your highest and lowest tones as in your natural conversational
or middle tones.</p>

<p>In high pitch, read in as high pitch as you can, and at the
same time keep the tone pure, and you will find your voice
gradually gain in compass.</p>

<p>In middle pitch, read in your conversational tone, with
earnestness.</p>

<p>In low pitch, read somewhat lower than middle pitch,
and make as full a tone as you can.</p>

<p>In very low pitch, read as low in pitch as you can with
ease, and do not try to make it loud or full until you have
had considerable practice. Don't pinch or strain the throat:
if you do, the quality will be bad.</p>

<h3>QUALITY.</h3>

<p>As there are all kinds and qualities of emotions, so there
are all kinds and qualities of voice to express them. The
shade and varieties of these qualities are as infinite in number
as the emotions they express. We need, however, in
practice, to make but four general divisions,&mdash;whisper, aspirate,
pure, and orotund. The whisper expresses secrecy,
fear, and like emotions. It is seldom required in reading,
as the aspirate is expressive of the same, and you would be
likely to use that instead of whisper. You should practise
the whisper until you can make it very clear, and free from
all impurity, or sound of throat, and full, so as to be heard
at a distance. In both whisper and aspirate leave the throat
free and open; and be energetic, remembering that force is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
made by control of muscles at the waist, and not by effort
of throat or mouth. The clearer you can make a whisper,
the better quality you can make in pure and orotund. Pure
tone or quality is sound made with no disagreeable quality
being heard; and is the same as pleasant quality, spoken of
as being necessary to make listeners. Pure quality is made
with ease, with no waste of breath, and is used for expression
of agreeable feelings. Orotund is a magnified, pure
tone, and adds richness and power to the voice in speech. It
is the expression of intense feelings, usually slow in movement,
as grandeur, sublimity, awe, &amp;c. It can only be obtained
by much practice and much patience, allowing the
voice to grow in fulness, as it will in time, if practice continues.</p>

<h3>MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>By different emotions you are prompted to speak words in
quick or slow utterance, as in joy or anger you would be
prompted to utter words quickly; while in majesty, sublimity,
awe, you would speak slowly. You should practise
movement, that you may be able to read rapidly and with
perfect articulation, and also to read slowly with proper
phrasing. In quick movement, read as fast as you can with
proper articulation, phrasing, and emphasis. In moderate
movement, read as in ordinary earnest conversation. In slow
and very slow movement, phrase well, as in these the emphatic
words have the longest time given to them, the
secondarily emphatic ones less time, and the connecting
words the least time; and it is a great art to proportion them
rightly. If you do not do the latter, you will drawl.</p>

<p>2. Oratory, as it consists in the expression of the countenance,
graces of attitude and motion, and intonation of
voice, although it is altogether superficial and ornamental,
will always command admiration; yet it deserves little veneration.
Flashes of wit, coruscations of imagination, and
gay pictures,&mdash;what are they? Strict truth, rapid reason,
and pure integrity, are the only essential ingredients in
oratory. I flatter myself that Demosthenes, by his "action,
action, action," meant to express the same opinion.</p>

<h3>FORCE.</h3>

<p>Every emotion which you have you feel more or less intensely,
and that intensity is expressed through the force
of the voice. The degree of force with which you speak
will be according to the degree of intensity of emotion; and
even in the gentlest tone you can express as forcibly as in
the loudest. According to your strength of body and mind,
and intensity of feeling, you have been accustomed to express
in a strong or feeble voice. Force needs to be practised
to enable you to fill a large hall with your gentlest
tone, and to make very loud tones without straining of
throat. In gentle force, sustain the breath well, as in fulness
and power, observing directions there given; and make your
tone soft and pure. In moderate force, be as energetic as in
earnest conversation. In loud and very loud force, observe
directions under "Fulness and Power."</p>

<h3>STRESS.</h3>

<p>In expressing your emotions, the voice is ejected in various
ways; perhaps in a jerky or trembling or flowing manner,
as may be, depending on the kind of emotion you feel.
This is called "Stress;" and you have learned how, mechanically,
to make it. Radical Stress is used when you try to
impress upon others your exact meaning. Practise it with
that thought in your mind. Median Stress is used in
appeal to the best affections, and expresses agreeable emotions.
The swell comes on emphatic words. Terminal
Stress is used in expressions of anger, petulance, impatience,
and the like. Thorough Stress is used in calling to
persons at a long distance, but has little place in expression.
It is frequently substituted by bad readers or speakers for
Median or Terminal Stress. Compound Stress is used in
strong passion; and being a compound of Radical and Terminal
Stress, and used with circumflex inflections, it combines
the meaning of them all, as sarcasm, irony, &amp;c.,
mixed with anger, impatience, doubt, &amp;c. Tremolo Stress
is used in excessive emotion; as joy, anger, sorrow, in
excess, would cause the voice to tremble. You should practise
this in order to avoid it, as, when Tremolo does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
proceed from real excess of feeling, it has a very ludicrous
effect. Practise the following exercises by thinking and
feeling the idea and emotion.</p>


<p class="center">RADICAL STRESS.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. &nbsp; Hark, hark! the lark sings mid the silvery blue:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Behold her flight, proud man, and lowly bow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>2. There is the act of utterance, a condition that exists
between you and myself. I speak, and you hear; but how?
The words issue from my lips, and reach your ears; but
what are those words? Volumes of force communicated to
the atmosphere, whose elastic waves carry them to fine
recipients in your own organism. But still I ask, How?
How is it that these volumes of sound should convey articulate
meaning, and carry ideas from my mind into your own?</p>

<p>3. I call upon you, fathers, by the shades of your ancestors,
by the dear ashes which repose in this precious soil, by
all you are and all you hope to be,&mdash;resist every object of
disunion; resist every encroachment upon your liberties; resist
every attempt to fetter your consciences, or smother
your public schools, or extinguish your system of public
instruction.</p>


<p class="center">MEDIAN STRESS.</p>

<span class="i1">And established it upon the floods.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>2. Oh divine, oh delightful legacy of a spotless reputation!
Rich is the inheritance it leaves; pious the example it
testifies; pure, precious, and imperishable the hope which
it inspires. Can there be conceived a more atrocious injury
than to filch from its possessor this inestimable benefit; to
rob society of its charm, and solitude of its solace; not only
to outlaw life, but to attaint death, converting the very
grave, the refuge of the sufferer, into the gate of infamy
and of shame?</p>

<h3>TRANSITION.</h3>

<p>The changes from one kind of force to another, or one
pitch to another, or one movement to another, or one quality
to another, are many in expressive reading; and these changes
are called "Transition." To practise it is very useful in
breaking up monotony of voice, and adding expressiveness
to it. In practice of these short extracts, you are showing
the benefit of practice in quality, pitch, movement, and force.
Put yourself into the thought and feeling, and vary the voice
as that, guided by common sense, may suggest to you.</p>

<h3>MODULATION.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis not enough the voice be loud and clear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis <span class="smcap lowercase">MODULATION</span> that must charm the ear."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A good reader or speaker will vary his or her voice in the
elements of emotional expression (that is, pitch, quality,
movement, stress, force), on words, phrases, and sentences,
in such a manner that the listeners get a suggestion of the
meaning of a word by the sound of it. For instance, the
words <i>bright</i>, <i>glad</i>, <i>joyful</i>, <i>dull</i>, <i>sad</i>, <i>weak</i>, may be pronounced
in such a manner as to suggest by the quality of voice used
their meaning; and, in the same manner, phrases and whole
sentences may have variation in voice so as to suggest their
meaning. This is modulation.</p>

<p>To modulate well, first, you must use your imagination, to
form a perfect picture in your own mind of what you wish to
describe, just as you would if you were an artist, and were
intending to paint an ideal picture; and, in reality, you are
an artist, for you paint with words and tones. Secondly,
you should understand the exact meaning of each word, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
when you speak it, make your manner of speaking it suggest
its meaning. Suppose you were to read Tennyson's "Song
of the Brook." We will analyze as near as words may the
manner of reading each verse. Read the whole song, and
form the picture in imagination of the flow of the water, the
scenery along its course, the roughness or smoothness of the
water as described, the slowness or rapidity of its flow at
different points, how large or small the brook is, making the
picture as perfect as if you would paint upon canvas the
whole scene.</p>

<p>As a whole, this piece requires for quality of voice the
<i>pure tone</i>; force, <i>gentle</i>; movement, <i>moderate</i>; pitch, <i>middle</i>;
stress, <i>median</i>. The variations in modulation must be from
these, and will be mostly variations in quality, movement,
and pitch.</p>

<p>Lines 2 to 6. Movement, quick; pitch, high; with quality
changing on words <i>sudden</i>, <i>sparkle</i>, <i>bicker</i>, <i>hurry</i>, <i>slip</i>, in such
a way as to suggest the meaning of the word.</p>

<p>Lines 7 to 12. Movement, moderate; pitch, middle.</p>

<p>Lines 13 to 16. Movement, quick; pitch, high; the words
<i>chatter</i>, <i>stony</i>, <i>sharps</i>, <i>trebles</i>, <i>bubble</i>, <i>babble</i>, spoken with suggestion
of their meaning.</p>

<p>Lines 17 to 20. Movement, moderate; pitch, middle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Lines 21 to 24. Movement, quick; pitch, high; make
quality suggest on <i>chatter</i>, <i>brimming</i>.</p>

<p>Lines 25 to 28. Movement, slow; pitch, middle; change
to suggestive quality on <i>wind</i>, <i>blossom</i>, <i>lusty</i>.</p>

<p>Lines 29 to 36. Movement, moderate; pitch, middle; suggestive
quality on <i>foamy</i>, <i>silvery</i>, <i>golden</i>, <i>brimming</i>.</p>

<p>Lines 37 to 40. Movement, slow; pitch, low; suggestive
quality on <i>steal</i>, <i>slide</i>, <i>move</i>, <i>happy</i>.</p>

<p>Lines 41, 42. Movement, pitch, quality, all varied on
words <i>slip</i>, <i>slide</i>, <i>gloom</i>, <i>glance</i>.</p>

<p>Lines 43, 44. Movement, quick; pitch, high; suggestive
quality on <i>dance</i>, <i>shallows</i>.</p>

<p>Lines 45 to 48. Movement, slow; pitch, low; quality,
very slightly aspirate; suggestive quality on <i>murmur</i>, <i>linger</i>,

<p>Lines 49 to 52. Movement, moderate; pitch, middle; suggestive
quality on <i>brimming</i>.</p>

<p>This analysis is very imperfect, as it is impossible in words
to explain it. What modulation requires is, as a popular
author says, "genius and sense" on your part, and you will
be enabled to do as here is imperfectly suggested. You will
do well to select some pieces, and analyze them, as here suggested.
In Longfellow's launch of the ship, in his poem
"Building of the Ship," picture the whole scene in imagination,
the size and kind of ship, the number of the crowd, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following pieces are marked so that you may get a
general idea of what is required for emotional expression in
each. No marking can give you particulars of what is necessary,
as the modulation of voice or variety in emotional
expression&mdash;the light and shadow in the coloring of your
word-picture&mdash;must depend upon your artistic "sense and
genius." Imagine your picture, understand the meaning of
every word and suggest its meaning in tone, concentrate
yourself in the thought and feeling of the piece, and let your
voice be governed by that, and you will not go far wrong if
you have faithfully practised what has been recommended in
the previous pages of this book.</p>

<span class="i0">Proclaim the storm-demon still raging afar:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The black cloud strides upward, the lightning more red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the roll of the thunder more deep and more dread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thick pall of darkness is cast o'er the air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on bounds the blast with a howl from its lair.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The lightning darts zig-zag and forked through the gloom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bolt launches o'er with crash, rattle, and boom:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gray forest eagle&mdash;where, where has he sped?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does he shrink to his eyrie, or shiver with dread?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does the glare blind his eye? Has the terrible blast<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No, no! the brave eagle, he thinks not of fright:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wrath of the tempest but rouses delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To the flash of the lightning his eye casts a gleam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the shriek of the wild blast he echoes his scream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with front like a warrior that speeds to the fray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a clapping of pinions, he's up and away.<br /></span>

<p>Rhetoric as taught in our seminaries and by elocutionists
is one thing: genuine, heart-thrilling, soul-stirring eloquence
is a very different thing. The one is like the rose in wax,
without odor; the other like the rose on its native bush, perfuming
the atmosphere with the rich odors distilled from the
dew of heaven.</p>

<p>The one is the finely-finished statue of a Cicero or Demosthenes,
more perfect in its lineaments than the original,
pleasing the eye, and enrapturing the imagination: the other
is the living man, animated by intellectual power, rousing
the deepest feelings of every heart, and electrifying every
soul as with vivid lightning. The one is a picture of the
passions all on fire: the other is the real conflagration, pouring
out a volume of words that burn like liquid flames bursting
from the crater of a volcano.</p>

<p>The one attracts the admiring gaze and tickles the fancy
of an audience: the other sounds an alarm that vibrates
through the tingling ears to the soul, and drives back the
rushing blood upon the aching heart. The one falls upon
the multitude like April showers glittering in the sunbeams,
animating, and bringing nature into mellow life: the other
rouses the same mass to deeds of noble daring, and imparts
to it the terrific force of an avalanche.</p>

<p>The one moves the cerebral foliage in waves of recumbent
beauty like a gentle wind passing over a prairie of tall grass
and flowers: the other strikes a blow that resounds through
the wilderness of mind like rolling thunder through a forest
of oaks. The one fails when strong commotions and angry
elements agitate the public peace: the other can ride upon
the whirlwind, direct the tornado, and rule the storm.</p>

<h3>STYLE.</h3>

<p>What you have to say, where you have to say it, when you
have to say it, why you have to say it, and to whom you have
to say it,&mdash;on these depend how you shall say it, or your style.
Conversational style is as you would talk in earnest conversation
with a friend; Narrative, as you would tell an anecdote
or story to a company of friends; Descriptive, as you
would describe what you had actually seen; Didactic, as
you would state earnestly, decisively, but pleasantly, your
knowledge or opinions to others; Public Address, which
generally includes the Didactic, Narrative, and Descriptive,
is spoken with design to move, to persuade, and instruct,
particularly the latter; Declamatory is Public Address
magnified in expression, exhibiting more emotion, both in
language, and in quality, and fulness of voice; the Emotional
or Dramatic, in which the emotions and passions are
strongly expressed. In practising these different styles, the
quality, pitch, force, and time must be regulated by your
thought and feeling, guided, as in transition, by common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
sense, which will enable you to tell natural from unnatural
expression. Practise these few exercises under each head;
but you will do better to practise pieces such as are referred
to under each head in the "Reading Club."</p>

down beside her.</p>

<p>"He's bad; he's bad!" said Betty. "I begin to be afeerd
he'll not be yours any more than mine. All others belonging
to him have gone to the Power and the Glory; and I have

away."</p>

it had hold of a finger that I can't see; look at it!" said

<p>"Oh, it is so graceful!" said another young lady.</p>

<p>A third young lady said it was elegant; and a fourth expressed
her opinion that it was "swan-like."</p>

<p>"I should be very happy, I'm sure," said Mr. Winkle,
reddening; "but I have no skates."</p>

<p>This objection was at once overruled. Trundle had got
a couple of pair, and the fat boy announced that there were
half a dozen more down stairs; whereat Mr. Winkle expressed
exquisite delight, and looked exquisitely uncomfortable.</p>

<p>2. The illustrious Spinola, upon hearing of the death of a
friend, inquired of what disease he died. "Of having nothing
to do," said the person who mentioned it. "Enough,"
said Spinola, "to kill a general." Not only the want of
employment, but the want of care, often increases as well as

Isaac: "it happened there." The gentleman looked up in

but its beam has long left the garden of Gethsemane, and the
tomb of Absalom, the waters of Kedron, and the dark abyss
of Jehoshaphat. Full falls its splendor, however, on the
opposite city, vivid and defined in its silver blaze. A lofty
wall, with turrets and towers and frequent gates, undulates
with the unequal ground which it covers, as it encircles the
lost capital of Jehovah. It is a city of hills, far more famous

we always associate with the idea of abundance. The forests
had put on their sober brown and yellow; while some trees
of the tenderer kind had been nipped by the frosts into brilliant
dyes of orange, purple, and scarlet. Streaming files of
wild ducks began to make their appearance high in the air;
the bark of the squirrel might be heard from the groves of
beech and hickory nuts, and the pensive whistle of the quail
at intervals from the neighboring stubble-field.</p>

<p>1. Let not, then, the young man sit with folded hands,
calling on Hercules. Thine own arm is the demigod: it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
was given thee to help thyself. Go forth into the world
trustful, but fearless. Exalt thine adopted calling or profession.
Look on labor as honorable, and dignify the task
before thee, whether it be in the study, office, counting-room,
work-shop, or furrowed field. There is an equality in all,
and the resolute will and pure heart may ennoble either.</p>

<p>2. While you are gazing on that sun which is plunging
into the vault of the west, another observer admires him
emerging from the gilded gates of the east. By what inconceivable
power does that ag&egrave;d star, which is sinking fatigued
and burning in the shades of the evening, re-appear at the
same instant fresh and humid with the rosy dew of the
morning? At every hour of the day the glorious orb is at
once rising, resplendent as noonday, and setting in the west;
or rather our senses deceive us, and there is, properly speaking,
no east or west, no north or south, in the world.</p>

<p>3. In all natural and spiritual transactions, so far as they
come within the sphere of human agency, there are three
distinct elements: there is an element of endeavor, of
mystery, and of result; in other words, there is something
for man to do, there is something beyond his knowledge and
control, there is something achieved by the co-operation of
these two. Man sows the seed, he reaps the harvest; but
between these two points occurs the middle condition of
mystery. He casts the seed into the ground; he sleeps and
rises night and day; but the seed springs and grows up, he
knows not how: yet, when the fruit is ripe, immediately he
putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. That is
all he knows about it. There is something for him to do,
something for him to receive; but between the doing and
receiving there is a mystery.</p>

<p>1. You speak like a boy,&mdash;like a boy who thinks the old
gnarled oak can be twisted as easily as the young sapling.
Can I forget that I have been branded as an outlaw, stigmatized
as a traitor, a price set on my head as if I had been
a wolf, my family treated as the dam and cubs of the hill-fox,
whom all may torment, vilify, degrade, and insult; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
very name which came to me from a long and noble line of
martial ancestors denounced, as if it were a spell to conjure
up the devil with?</p>

<p>2. I have been accused of ambition in presenting this
measure,&mdash;inordinate ambition. If I had thought of myself
only, I should have never brought it forward. I know
well the perils to which I expose myself,&mdash;the risk of alienating
faithful and valued friends, with but little prospect of
making new ones (if any new ones could compensate for the
loss of those we have long tried and loved), and the honest
misconception both of friends and foes. Ambition!&mdash;yes,
I have ambition; but it is the ambition of being the humble
instrument in the hands of Providence to reconcile a divided
people, once more to revive concord and harmony in a distracted
land; the pleasing ambition of contemplating the
glorious spectacle of a free, united, prosperous, and fraternal
people.</p>

<p>3. Tell me, ye who tread the sods of yon sacred height, is
Warren dead? Can you not still see him, not pale and prostrate,
the blood of his gallant heart pouring out of his ghastly
wound, but moving resplendent over the field of honor, with
the rose of heaven upon his cheek, and the fire of liberty in
his eye? Tell me, ye who make your pious pilgrimage to
the shades of Vernon, is Washington indeed shut up in that
cold and narrow house? That which made these men, and
men like these, cannot die. The hand that traced the charter
of Independence is indeed motionless; the eloquent lips that
sustained it are hushed: but the lofty spirits that conceived,
resolved, and maintained it, and which alone, to such men,
"make it life to live,"&mdash;these cannot expire.</p>

<h2>PART FOUR.<br />

HINTS ON ELOCUTION.</h2>


<div class="sidenote"><i>Practice.</i></div>
<p>If you have practised and studied the previous pages of
this book, you will have gained an elementary knowledge of
the science of elocution. Carlyle says, "The grand result
of schooling is a mind with just vision to discern,
with free force to do: the grand school-*master
is Practice." To make an artist of yourself in elocution
requires much practice and much patience. As Longfellow
says, "Art is long, and time is fleeting;" and the
art of elocution is no exception to that truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Health.</i></div>
<p>You must have health, strength, and elasticity of body;
and, to get and keep these, obey the laws of life as to exercise,
rest, pure air, good food, and temperance in all things.
Avoid all stimulants, or tobacco in any form. Practise any
gymnastics that shall help to make you strong
and sprightly, but especially the physical gymnastics
here given, as they are designed to benefit the
muscles used in speaking.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Position.</i></div>
<p>When you stand to speak, the first thing that strikes your
audience is the position you assume. Therefore be careful
to assume and keep the speaker's position until some other
position is needed for expression; and return to
the speaker's position, as the one which is an
active position, but gives the idea of repose and confidence,
without that disagreeable self-consciousness which to an
audience is disgusting. While you are speaking, avoid all
swaying or motion of body, unless it means something.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bowing.</i></div>
<p>Do not bow too quickly, but do it with dignity, and
respect to your audience, first with a general, quick glance
of the eye about you. Bend the body at the hip-joints;
let the back bend a little, and the head
more than the body. Do not bow too low, nor be stiff in
your movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Holding book.</i></div>
<p>How to hold the book has been shown in Part One; and
you will find that to be the position that strikes
the audience most favorably, and gives an impression
of ease, which goes a great way towards
making the audience enjoy your reading.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Articulation.</i></div>
<p>When you speak, it is for the purpose of making yourself
understood. And to do this you must articulate perfectly;
that is, give a clear and correct utterance
every element in a word. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>
<i>Pronunciation.</i><span class="hidev">|</span></span>You must also
pronounce properly,&mdash;that is, accent the proper
syllable in a word; and, to find out what the proper syllable
is, refer to Webster's or Worcester's large Dictionary
(Worcester being preferable), and find
out for yourself. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>
<i>Emphasis.</i><span class="hidev">|</span></span>
You must also give the right
phrasing, subordinating all other phrases to the principal
one, and remembering that the emphatic word of
your sentence is the emphatic word of the important
phrase. The emphatic word is usually brought out by
inflection and added force; but it may be made emphatic by
particular stress, or a pause before it or after it, or both before
and after, or by a change of quality. Your own common
sense will tell you when these may be proper and effective
and natural.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Fulness and power.</i></div>
<p>You must also make your audience hear you; and this requires,
not a loud, high-pitched voice, but&mdash;unless dramatic
expression requires otherwise&mdash;your middle or
conversational pitch, with fulness of voice, that
shall give you power. Your own mind will regulate
this for you, if you will direct your attention to the
persons in the back part of the hall, and speak in middle
pitch, so that they may hear. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>
<i>Avoid high pitch.</i><span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Many speakers make the
mistake of using a high pitch, and render their
speech very ineffective by so doing. You will
call to mind the fact, that, when we say we cannot
hear a speaker, it is not that we do not hear the sound
of his voice, but that we cannot understand the words.
Bearing this in mind, you will see that perfect articulation
is what is wanted, and that fulness added to your voice in
middle pitch will make the voice reach, will require less
effort, and will produce better effect.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Feeling.</i></div>
<p>Having made your audience understand and hear, you
must then make them feel. To do this as public
reader, actor, clergyman, lawyer, teacher, orator,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
lecturer, you must yourself feel what you have to say, and,
forgetting every thing else in your subject, concentrate your
whole being in your utterance and action. Then you will
be effective, and you will carry your audience with you.
And you will fail in proportion as you fail to lose your own
personality in your subject. "The heart giveth grace unto
every art;" and of no art is this more true than of elocution.
You may have all the graces of elocution which practice will
give you; yet, in the effect these will produce,&mdash;if the will,
acting alone, not being guided by mind and heart, prompts
the utterance,&mdash;something will be lacking, of which learned
and unlearned alike will be conscious.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Be natural.</i></div>
<p>"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin," and
cultivated and uncultivated alike will feel it; and this
"touch of nature" you will show if you enter
into what you have to say with mind, heart, and
soul. Your voice will vary in all the elements of emotional
expression, and you will be natural.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mechanical speaking.</i></div>
<p>When speaking in public, do not try to remember the first
rule of elocution. Leave it all behind you when you come
before the audience. Speak from your thought and feeling,
and be sure you are thoroughly familiar with what you have
to say. Be sure you understand it yourself before
you try to make others understand. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>
<i>Words without meaning.</i><span class="hidev">|</span></span>You can
read words, calling them off mechanically, or
you can speak words from memory very mechanically,
and not have a clear idea of the meaning the
words convey while you speak them. But do not
do this. Always think the thought, as you read
or speak, in the same manner as you would if speaking extempore.
You can express your thought clearly by thinking
it as you speak; but at the same time there may
be no expression of emotion. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>
<i>Thought without feeling.</i><span class="hidev">|</span></span>
You may have thought without feeling; but you must impress
your thought by feeling. When you read, your mind gets
the thought through the words, and from that thought
comes feeling; but, when you speak your own thoughts, the
feeling creates the thought. In reading, you think, and then
feel; but, in speaking your thought, you feel, and then think.
When you read, then, or speak from memory, if you will let
thought create feeling before you speak, you will avoid mechanical
reading and speaking, and be effective in conveying
the thought and feeling both together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Feeling without thought.</i></div>
<p>You can convey emotion without a definite thought; and
this is as bad as either words without meaning, or thought
without feeling. This arousing the feelings without
guiding them by definite thought is the province
of the art of music. Elocution is superior
to music for the reason that it guides both thought and feeling,
for certainly it is better that mind and feeling should
work together, than either alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Emotion in song or speech.</i></div>
<p>The elements of emotional expression are alike in speech
and song. In each you have quality, time, force, and pitch.
The variation of these elements makes expression
of feeling; and each sound you make contains all
these elements. It has a certain quality; it has
more or less of force; it is relatively high or low in pitch, it
takes a longer or shorter time. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>
<i>Variety in expression.</i><span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The more you
vary in the elements of emotional expression, the
better the effect, provided the variation is caused
by the variation of your feeling, and not by any artificiality,
or seeming to express what you do not feel.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Quality.</i><br />
<i>Force.</i><br />
<i>Pitch.</i><br />
<i>Time.</i></div>
<p>The quality of voice, its purity or harshness, its aspiration,
&amp;c., will vary with the kind of feeling; the
degree of force will vary according to the intensity
of feeling; the pitch will be according to
what we may call the height or depth of your
feeling; the movement, or time, will be according
as the emotion is quick or slow. After having cultivated the
voice well in these elements of emotional expression, your
own common sense ought to be your best guide in the application
of them to reading and speaking. You, for the time
being, should be the author of what you read. "Put yourself
in his place," and express as you feel that he felt while
writing it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Feeling without expression.</i></div>
<p>It is possible for you to feel intense emotion, and not be
capable of properly expressing it, so as to make others feel
it. You may not have had training that will give
you command of sound and motion, those channels
of expression through which the body is
made to obey mind and soul, and express their thought and
feeling. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>
<i>No expression without feeling.</i><span class="hidev">|</span></span>
It is impossible to express, even with
the best cultivation, what, at the moment of utterance,
you do not feel: therefore you must sink
your own personality in your subject; and, according to your
conception, so will you express.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Reserve power.</i></div>
<p>All apparent effort must be avoided; that is, in the expression
of the strongest passion or emotion, you must not
give the audience the slightest indication of want
of power. You will give that impression if you
try to express more than you actually feel. In
emotional expression it must seem as if it overflowed because
of excess, and you could hardly control it; but you must
never lose control of it. This control will give the audience
the impression that you feel more than you express, and is
what is called reserved power. If&mdash;your well of emotion
not being overflowingly full&mdash;you use a force-pump, or, in
other words, your will-power, to make it overflow, you will
fail in expression.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>How to get reserve power.</i></div>
<p>How are you to get this, you ask. By study and long
practice. As you plainly see, it involves a perfect command
over the feelings; and "he that ruleth his own
spirit is greater than he that taketh a city."
Conquer yourself. All art, elocution included, is
but a means of expression for man's thoughts and feelings;
and, if you have no thought or feeling to express, art is useless
to you.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Breathing.</i></div>
<p>Do not let your audience be reminded that you breathe at
all. Take breath quietly through nostrils or mouth, or both.
Form the habit of keeping the chest, while speaking,
active, as recommended in all vocal exercises;
and the breath will flow in unobstructed whenever needed.
Breathe as nearly as possible as you would if you were not
speaking, that is, do not interfere with right action of the
lungs. The instant you feel a want of breath, take it: if
you do not, you will injure your lungs; and what you say,
feeling that want of breath, will lack power. The more
breath you have, so that it does not feel uncomfortable and
can be well controlled, the more power you will have: therefore
practise breathing until you breathe rightly and easily.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Throat trouble.</i></div>
<p>If your general health is good, your throat will be well;
and therefore pay attention to the general health of the
whole body, and the throat will take care of itself.
If, when you come before an audience, your
throat and mouth are dry, use only clear, cold
water, not ice-water: that is too cold. Avoid candy or
throat-lozenges; for the use of either of these is worse than
if you used nothing at all. If you have a cold or sore throat,
you had better not use your voice; but, if you must use it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
keep it clear by clear water. A healthy throat will not need
even water: it will moisten itself after a little use, if at first
it is dry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pausing.</i></div>
<p>Deliberate movement and frequent pausing are very expressive
in some cases. Where it is applicable may be determined
by what you have to express. Pausing
in its appropriate place makes emphasis strong.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>
<i>Punctuation.</i><span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Let the pause be regulated, however, by the feeling, and not
all by the punctuation. Express according to your conception
of the thought. Punctuation may be a
guide to you in obtaining the right idea; but it is
no guide to correct expression. Pausing, generally, comes
naturally either before or after, or both before and after, the
emphatic word or phrase.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Poetry.</i></div>
<p>Speak or read poetry with the same care and attention to
phrasing that you would give to prose, and you will avoid all
drawling, monotony, or sing-song. In order that
the rhyme in poetry may be preserved, the pronunciation
of a word may be changed from common usage, if,
by so doing, you do not obscure the meaning; but never sacrifice
the meaning for the sake of the rhyme. In good
poetry, which includes blank verse, the metrical movement
will show itself without any attempt on your part to make it
prominent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Stage fright.</i></div>
<p>You may feel, when you first come before an audience, a
shrinking, or faintness of feeling, such as is known to actors
as "stage fright." It probably arises from a very
sensitive, nervous organization; and, other things
being equal, persons of this character make the best speakers.
As to the real cause of this feeling, as Lord Dundreary says,
"It's one of those things no fellah can find out." But,
whatever its cause, you can overcome it by strong will-power
and self-possession; and, after a time, you will become used to
appearance in public, and that will establish the "confidence
of habit." Some of the best orators and actors that ever lived
have had "stage fright;" and some of them, so far as we
know, never had it. So you must not flatter yourself that
this is a certain indication of your power. It takes much
more than a tendency to "stage fright" to make a powerful
speaker.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Reading.</i><br />
<i>Speaking.</i><br />
<i>Recitation.</i></div>
<p>Whether you are reading from a book or paper, reciting
from memory, or speaking extempore your own thought, you
should do all as you would the latter, so that a blind man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
who could not judge which you were doing except by the
sound of your voice, would be unable to tell. In
committing to memory for recitation, you will
remember more easily if you will pick out the emphatic
words of the sentences in their order, and commit
them, as they contain an outline of the succession of thought
and meaning.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Action.</i></div>
<p>The look upon the face, the gestures of the arm, the attitude
of the body, all speak the language of emotion as
plainly to the eye as elocution proper does to the
ear. This action will be prompted by the feelings,
as the voice is; and it will be expressive or not, it will be
appropriate or not, it will be graceful or not, according as
you have natural or acquired ability. Natural ability will
be much aided by a knowledge and practice of gesture as a
language, and much may be acquired by any one with practice.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Look.</i><br />
<i>Gesture.</i><br />
<i>Attitude.</i></div>
<p>I have said nothing of action in the previous pages, as
this book treats of expression through the voice, or elocution.
A few words here upon the subject will not be out of
place. When you read, you should ordinarily make your
voice express much, and use gesture sparingly, but, if you
feel prompted to make gestures, never do so while the eye
rests on the book. Look either at the audience,
or as may be indicated by the gesture. When
you recite, or speak extempore, you can add much
to the expression by look, gesture, and attitude.
In natural expression the face will first light up, and show
feeling; and the attitude and gesture follow more or less
quickly, according to the feeling; and then comes speech.
And all these must express alike. For the face to be expressionless,
or to express one thing while the speech and gesture
say another thing, is in effect ludicrous.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Motion without meaning.</i></div>
<p>Remember that all motions and attitudes have meaning;
and, when no other gesture or attitude is called for to express
some feeling, stand perfectly still in the speaker's
position before mentioned, that being an active,
and at the same time a neutral position. Don't
move, unless you mean something by it. Don't sway the
body, or nod the head, or shrug the shoulders, or move the
feet, or make motions or gestures, unless the proper expression
call for it, and your emotion prompts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The eye.</i></div>
<p>The eye is particularly effective in expression, as there the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
emotion first shows itself; and by it you can get and keep
the attention of your audience. In reading, keep
your eye off the book as much as possible, and on
your audience. In recitation or extempore speaking, look
at your audience. The eye leads in gesture, and, in many
cases, looks in the direction of the gesture. In personation
of character, as in dramatic scenes, your eye must look at
those to whom you are supposed to be speaking, as, in common
conversation, you usually look at the person to whom
you speak. Never look in an undecided way, as if you did
not have a purpose in looking, but look in the face and eyes
of your audience when emotional expression does not require
you to look elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Gesture.</i></div>
<p>When you don't wish to use your arm for gesture, let it
hang naturally at the side. When the emotion calls for
gesture, make it with decision, and let the gesture
continue as long as you utter words explaining
the meaning of the gesture. Gesture always comes before
words, more or less quickly, as may be the kind of emotion.
Usually, if the words are quickly spoken, the gesture will be
quickly made, and the words will be spoken almost at instant
of the gesture. If the words move slow, the gesture
will move slow, and there may be a perceptible pause between
the gesture and words. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>
<i>No rules for gesture.</i><span class="hidev">|</span></span>
No stated rules for
gesture can be given; for they are as infinite in
number and variety as the emotions they express.
You will find, however, that gesture may be regulated, as
emotional expression of voice is, by means of your intensity
of thought and feeling, guided by common sense, and aided
by genius. Gesture is a science and art, which, as in speech
and song, has elements of emotional expression; and these
elements correspond in each. You have in gesture (as said
of the others) quality or kind of gesture, force or intensity
in gesture, time or the degree of movement in gesture, and
pitch, or relative height and depth; and all these have a
meaning something like the corresponding elements of song,
or speech, or other arts. Long and hard study and practice
will be necessary to perfection in this, as in all arts. A
graceful habit of gesture, an appropriate expression of eye
and face, united to a voice full-toned, musical, and varying
in all shades of emotional expression,&mdash;what is there more
captivating to eye and ear, more pleasing to the senses,
more instructive to the mind, more moving to the emotions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
if only it is, as Mendelssohn says of all art, expressive of
lofty thought? "Every art can elevate itself above a mere
handicraft only by being devoted to the expression of lofty
thought."</p>


<h3>DEFECTS OF SPEECH.</h3>

<p>Defects of speech cannot be spoken of at great length in
this book. A thorough study of articulation in Parts One
and Two will cure any of them where there is no defect in
the mouth. The letter <i>s</i> is more often defective than any
other letter, it being pronounced like <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i>, or whistled.
In the first the tongue is too far forward: in the last it is
drawn too far back. Cure by imitating somebody who
makes it correctly. <i>R</i> is often defective by substituting <i>w</i>
for it; as, <i>wun</i> for <i>run</i>. Sometimes it is defective by being
made with the whole tongue, something as <i>y</i> is made; as,
<i>yun</i> for <i>run</i>: and cure may be had by imitating the correct
sound. Other defects of letters or elementary sounds are
less common, and need not be mentioned here.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Too precise speech.</i></div>
<p>Too precise speech is a defect, and results from trying to
give too much force to the consonant sounds, and not a due
proportion to the vowel sounds. It sounds like
affectation on the part of the speaker, and may
be corrected by giving more force to the vowels,
and particular attention to phrasing. (See "Articulation,"
Part Three.)</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Slovenly speech.</i></div>
<p>Slovenly speech is a defect, and is opposite in kind and
effect from the above. The consonants are not
pronounced; and, to remedy it, practise to give
consonants more force and precision, and pay attention
to phrasing and emphasis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Too rapid speech.</i></div>
<p>Speaking too rapidly is a defect, and results from too rapid
thought. Put a restraint upon thought,&mdash;that
is, control it,&mdash;and make the tongue move slower
in consequence, being careful to phrase and emphasize
well.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Too slow speech.</i></div>
<p>Speaking too slowly is also a defect, opposite in kind from
rapid speech, and is caused by the mind moving
too slowly in thinking. The remedy is to think
faster, and urge the tongue to move quicker.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Stuttering.</i></div>
<p>When you have too slow thought and too rapid speech, you
have stuttering; for the tongue keeps moving all the time
while the thought is coming, and it repeats syllables or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
words. Make the mind of the stutterer move faster, and
the tongue talk slower. In each of these last
three defects, let the person who wants to cure it
"know what you wish to say before you attempt to say it."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Stammering.</i></div>
<p>Stammering is caused by too much effort on the part of
the person to make articulate sounds, and is usually the result
of imitating some one who stammered, or
formed gradually by habit of incorrect breathing,
and from physical weakness. Stammerers make the attempt
to speak, and the lips or tongue or jaw become immovable,
or the words stick in their throat; and, because this takes
place, they make great effort to overcome it. The more
effort they make, the harder it is for them; and sometimes
this leads to contortions and jerkings of body and limbs that
are painful. To cure this takes a longer or shorter time, depending
on the state of health, the length of time the habit
has been in forming, the amount of jerking of limbs to
which the stammerer is subject, and the care taken by the
stammerer to practise much. A stammerer can be cured by
teaching articulation thoroughly. (See Parts One and Two
of this book; also Monroe's Fourth Reader.) Show every
element separately, and the position the mouth takes to
make it; then combine into syllables, then into words, then
into phrases. Show the stammerer, that, the less the effort
made, the easier will be the speaking. Impress upon the
stammerer's mind, "Make no effort to speak," and the
habit is to be overcome by long-continued practice and a
thorough and complete training in articulation. When reading,
be sure and read in phrases; that is, speak a phrase, as
a long word, without pause. Stammerers, being usually
feeble in health, should practise the physical and vocal gymnastics
(Parts One and Two), and particularly the breathing
exercises. When you have given the stammerer confidence,
and he or she finds that talking is as easy as walking or
singing, the cure is certain. There may be times of excitability
or nervousness when stammering will return; but these
times will be less and less frequent as health gets better and
confidence grows, and finally will not return. Remember,
stammerer, "make no effort." Be lazy, and even, at first,
slovenly in speech, and cure is certain.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
